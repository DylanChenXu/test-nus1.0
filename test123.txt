With the previous tip in mind, take your time on floors that you already have the desired stars on and heal up and charge ultimates for the next chamber.
Abyss cards (the buffs you choose every chamber) reset every day (same time as any other daily reset)
If you fail a floor, ask yourself what you could have done better instead of instantly blaming it on artifacts or units.
If abyss stresses you out, frustrates you, etc., it is not worth doing. Relax and come back to it when you have the gear to make it a breeze. It is a single player game, it should be fun.
